A collection of PowerShell scripts, modules, functions and cmdlets along with some Pester tests.

WorkDays.ps1 and WorkDays.Tests.ps1

I created these PowerShell functions (using PowerShell V2.0) many years ago as an exercise in PowerShell scripting
whilst also serving to determine the number of working days between any 2 dates.

The script is not international and only determines bank holidays in England. It has been updated recently to take
into account some of the recent changes to bank holidays, i.e. Platinum Jubilee bank holiday and VE day.

The Get-EasterSunday script uses an algorithm found elsewhere and I claim no ownership for it.
